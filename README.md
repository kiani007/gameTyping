# gameTyping
Typing game is all about fun. It is React App in which you can set a timer and check your regular typing speed. 

It is functional component based project in which I have use different hOOks useContext is the common sharing data place, and for increasing performance i have used useMemo hook.

In this project you will see how i have use useState and useEffect in useContext so it will render everytime any state have been changed but not effect to the other state
